### Basic Rules

- Customers can choose currency independent of their location or location of their servers.
- Each customer account can only have 1 currency.
- All payments from a customer need to be sent in the currency of the customer account. If a payment is sent in a currency that does not match the currency on the customer account, it will not be accepted and will be refunded to the payer.
- The currency is fixed by the first order and cannot be changed. A customer may create a new account with a different currency and ask to transfer subscriptions. Subscriptions prices will be changed to the new currency. An administration fee applies.

### Currency Change of a Customer Account

#### General Process

- A new customer account (the "new account") will be created and existing subscriptions will be moved there. This is an administrative task only; data/configuration of products will not be touched.
- The existing customer account (the "old account") will be removed and inaccessible.
- There will be a completely new account in the Customer Control Panel with
  - same personal data,
  - same subscriptions (no data loss),
  - new customer ID,
  - new login credentials,
  - no 2-factor authentication activated,
  - different prices in new currency,
  - clean payment history,
  - no invoices from the old account,
  - no account balance from the old account.

#### Terms and Conditions

- All subscriptions will be moved to the new account, not just parts of it.
- The account balance will not be transferred to the new account.
- The payment history and invoices will not be transferred to the new account. Invoices will no longer be available after the change.
- For all subscriptions new net prices in new currency (plus VAT where applicable) as shown on the [Contabo website](https://contabo.com/en/) need to be accepted.
- An administration fee of €25.00 / $30.00 (plus VAT where applicable) applies, based upon the currency of the old account. The one-time administration fee needs to be accepted.
- The process is irrevocable. Undoing the currency change retriggers the whole process, including costs.

#### Requirements

- The terms and conditions for the currency change need to be accepted.
- The [Contabo Terms & Conditions](https://contabo.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions/) need to be accepted.
- An accepted payment method for the new currency needs to be available.
- All invoices from the old account need to be downloaded before requesting the change.
- 2-factor authentication on the new account needs to be enabled/re-enabled on demand.
- Proper payment method on the new account needs to be arranged/rearranged.
- The administration fee needs to be paid in the currency of the old account. Account balance can be used alternatively.

### Potential Extra Charges

> Credit Card charges in USD ($) are still done by a German company which means that some payment providers may consider payments to Contabo as a foreign transaction and may charge extra fees on customer's side, even if there is no currency conversion.
