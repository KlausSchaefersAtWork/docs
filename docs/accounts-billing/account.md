# Account

## Creation

* You can create a customer account by signing up using this form <https://contabo.com/en/register/email/>.
* Alternatively, we will create a customer account for you when place your order.

## Deletion

* We remove every account after the last product on this account is cancelled.
* This means you will not be able to log in to [Customer Control Panel](https://my.contabo.com/) when you no longer have subscriptions.
* If you need services, just order as a new customer and we will create a new account for you.

## Transfer of Account

Please download this [form](/doc/accounts-billing/Transfer_of_Contract_Form.pdf), fill it in, sign and send it back to support.
