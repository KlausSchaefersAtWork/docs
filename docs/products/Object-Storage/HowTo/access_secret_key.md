When Contabo is provioning the S3 compatible Object Storage S3 credentials, namely `access key` and `secret key`, are being generated in a secure manner for you. If you wish to regenerate a new `secret key` plese follow these steps:

1. Login to the [Contabo Customer Panel](https://my.contabo.com/object_storage)
2. Navigate to `Object Storage`
3. (only once) Setup your password for the Object Storage Panel
4. Switch to Object Storag Panel
5. Navigate to `Account` -> `Security & Access`
6. Scroll to `S3 Object Storage Credentials`

There you shoul be able to copy the `access key` and `secret key`. Using `Regenerate Secret` a new `secret key` is being generated.

The follwing screenshot illustrates it.
