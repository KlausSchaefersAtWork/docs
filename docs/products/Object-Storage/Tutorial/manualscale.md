# Manual Increase of Storage Capacity

When purchasing Object Storage its capacity needs to be specified during the order process.
However, this storage space can be expanded at a later date.

## How can I increase the capacity of my Storage?

To increase the capacity of the storage:
* Log into your Object Storage Panel
* Open the tab 'Storage Settings' (see also in image above)
* Select a storage, go to 'more' and click on 'Add more GB'. The following menu appears:

</p>

In the menu you can set the amount of capacity you want your storage to increse in steps of 250GB.
After confirming the setting by hitting the 'Add & Pay' button the increased capacity is available to use.

## Where can I find more Product and Pricing Information about adding capacity to my Storage?

## How can I add more space to my Storage automatically?

By activating the Auto-Scaling feature the capacity of your storage increases automatically up to a preselected limit (in TB) as soon as the initially purchased limit is reached.
You find more information about the Auto-Scaling feature [here](/docs/products/Object-Storage/Tutorial/autoscale).
