# Supported Protocols

S3 compatible Object Storage has it's own protocol (i.e. how and in which sequence specified data formats are being exchanged) which Amazon AWS made popular in 2006 with AWS S3 Object Storage.

That's why protocols like:

* SFTP / SCP
* FTP / FTPS
* NFS / CIFS / SAMBA
* Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)

will **NOT** work with S3 compatible Object Storage.

Due to the popularity of S3 compatible Object Storage there are plenty of tools supporting S3 compatible Object Storage. We have compiled a list of tools with description on how to use them with Contabo's S3 compatible Object Storage. Please refer to [Tools](/docs/products/Object-Storage/Tools/compatibility).

Many of these tools are likely to be already used by you as they are also supporting SFTP / FTP.
